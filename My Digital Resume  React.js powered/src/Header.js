      <h1>Hello, I'm Atanas BobchevðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about <strong>C# Web Development</strong> and have been actively working towards mastering it.
        I began my studies in <strong>September 2022</strong> and successfully completed the <strong>SoftUni
          Professional Modules</strong> in <strong>August 2024</strong>. Iâ€™m excited to continue honing my skills in
        <strong>C# and Web Development</strong>, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and work on interesting
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>As a C# Developer, I specialize in building efficient and scalable web applications using C#, .NET,
        and ASP.NET Core. I combine a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic front-ends,
        integrating them with robust back-end systems powered by Microsoft SQL Server. I am looking for a new
        opportunity that aligns with my long-term career objectives and personal values in order to demonstrate my
        operational skills in a dynamic and collaborative work culture.
